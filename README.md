# Song-Showdown-V2
Inspired by the game Songtrivia2, I developed my own song guessing game. To learn Socket.io, I adapted the Songtrivia2 game to the professional wrestling theme, and added videos related to this theme to make the application more fun. Each round, a song is played and the player attempts to guess the wrestler or artist associated with the song from the four options given. The game can be played in single player or two player mode.

The second version does not contain the problems of the first version.
The synchronization problems in the first version were resolved in the second version, and the interface of the game was improved and made better for the user.
In the first version, the two-player game mode was broken, but it works smoothly in the second version.

The game can be played solo or with two players. Players can create a game by selecting a profile picture and username, or they can join a friend's room using an invitation code.

- Once the game starts, players must try to guess the playing song within 10 seconds.
- After guessing, a 30-second video of the artist who owns the song is played.
- Each game consists of 5 questions, and the game ends with a scoreboard after the 5th question.
